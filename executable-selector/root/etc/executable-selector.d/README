When executable selector is run, the executable name used in
conjunction with the value of /etc/host_type to look up a matching
file in /etc/executable-selector.d.  These may be scripts or more
often symlinks.

If /etc/host_type does not exist, it defaults to "default"

If it exists, "${EXE_NAME}.${HOST_TYPE}" is run.  If that doesn't
exist, "${EXE_NAME}" is run.  Otherwise an error message is produced.
